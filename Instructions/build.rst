Procedure
---------

Part 0 - getting started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. list-table:: Part 0 - Organize and prepare materials.
    :widths: 5 25 50
    :header-rows: 0
    :align: center

    * - 1 
      - All of the items you should have for the build.
      - .. image:: media/build_plate.jpg
            :width: 200 px
    * - 2
      - A complete BOM will come soon.
      - .. image:: media/missing.jpg
            :width: 200 px
    * - 3
      - Additional tools include a small (M2) allen key, craft knife and clippers
      - .. image:: media/additional_tools.jpg
            :width: 200 px
    * - 4
      - Each of the wheels was printed with a bit of material  in the center that must be removed with a craft knife.
      - .. image:: media/wheel_cleaning.jpg
          :width: 200 px
    * - 5
      - The base has two support beams that should be removed.
      - .. image:: media/base_plate_clips.jpg
          :width: 200 px
    * - 6
      - The steering frame has two support beams that should be removed.

Drive assembly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table:: Part 1 - Prepare the base and assemble the drive.
    :widths: 5 25 50
    :header-rows: 0
    :align: center

    * - 1 
      - The power switch can be pushed from the outside into one of the holes in the base. It should fit snugly, but you may use an M2 bolt and nut to secure the switch in place.
      - .. image:: media/switcha.jpg
          :width: 200 px
    * - 2
      - The nuts will not go flush against the plastic.
      - .. image:: media/switchb.jpg
          :width: 200 px
    * - 3
      - Obtain the DC motor, motor frames, thin gears, and some bolts (2x M3-8, 1x M3-20, 2x M3-25)
      - .. image:: media/drive_parts.jpg
          :width: 200 px
    * - 4
      - Sandwich the motor between the two frame pieces. Note that one of the pieces has room for the countersunk bolts. Secure the back of the motor with the M3-20 bolt and the front of the motor with the M3-25 bolts. The plastic is self threading and does not need a nut. 
      - .. image:: media/framed_motor.jpg
          :width: 200 px
    * - 5
      - Align the gears onto the white shaft posts of the motor. Use the M3-8 bolts to secure the gears to the shaft. These bolts will not screw entirely into the hole.
      - .. image:: media/drive_gears.jpg
          :width: 200 px

The drive is now complete and can be set aside until later in the build.

Steering Assembly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table:: Part 3 - Assemble the steering mechanism
    :widths: 5 25 50
    :header-rows: 0
    :align: center

    * - 1
      - Obtain the steering bar, steering arm, the two wheel blocks, the steering frame, and some bolts (2 each of  M3-8, M3-12 and M3-14)
      - .. image:: media/steering_parts.jpg
          :width: 200 px
    * - 2
      - Connect the two wheel blocks to the steering bar using the M3-12 bolts. Note that the wheel blocks are symmetric and do not have an *up*. The steering bar does have one side to support the countersunk bolts. 
      - .. image:: media/steering_1.jpg
          :width: 200 px
    * - 3
      - Turn over the steering bar and attach the steering arm using one of the M3-8 bolts. The arm has one side to support the countersunk bolts. Note that in this picture, the steering frame supports have not been clipped. If you haven't done this, do it now.
      - .. image:: media/steering_2.jpg
          :width: 200 px
    * - 4
      - Connect the bar/arm assembly to the frame using the remaining M3-8 bolt. Adjust the tightness of both M3-8 bolts so that the assembly moves freely but is not wobbly.
      - .. image:: media/steering_3.jpg
          :width: 200 px
    * - 5
      - Lastly, connect the wheel blocks to the steering frame with the M3-14 bolts.
      - .. image:: media/steering_4.jpg
          :width: 200 px

The steering assembly is now complete and can be set aside until later in the build.
