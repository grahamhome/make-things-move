      - Each of the wheels was printed with a bit of material  in the center that must be removed with a craft knife.

      - The base has two support beams that should be removed.

      - The steering frame has two support beams that should be removed.

.. list_table:: Part 1 - Prepare the base and assemble the drive

      - The power switch can be pushed from the outside into one of the holes in the base. It should fit snugly, but you may use an M2 bolt and nut to secure the switch in place.

      - The nuts will not go flush against the plastic.

    * - 3
      - Obtain the DC motor, motor frames, thin gears, and some bolts (2x M3-8, 1x M3-20, 2x M3-25)

    * - 4
      - Sandwich the motor between the two frame pieces. Note that one of the pieces has room for the countersunk bolts. Secure the back of the motor with the M3-20 bolt and the front of the motor with the M3-25 bolts. The plastic is self threading and does not need a nut.

    * - 5
      - Align the gears onto the white shaft posts of the motor. Use the M3-8 bolts to secure the gears to the shaft. These bolts will not screw entirely into the hole.

 The drive is now complete and can be set aside until later in the build.
